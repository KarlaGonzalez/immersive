Overview,"Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides is a mixed reality HoloLens 2 application that provides step by step holographic instructions, video demonstrations, 3D holographic models, and 3D guides that allow operators to visualize each step in their work and accomplish their tasks faster with few errors and increase skill retention. ","Dynamic 365 Remote Assist empowers teams to collaborate more efficiently by working together from different locations on HoloLens 2, Android, or iOS devices. With Remote Assist, everyone can see through the HoloLens 2, provide support via verbal instructions, and holographic overlays such as arrows pointing to a specific point of interest or circling a point of interest.","Altoura XR is a cloud-based XR platform that provides rich virtual, augmented, and mixed reality immersive experiences. Altoura's immersive virtual project, product tours, and training use a ""digital twin"" 3D model and a 1:1 full-scale model experience. Altoura XR is available on iOs, Android, Windows PC, and HoloLens 2. ","Matterport is a three-dimensional camera system used to create realistic, fully immersive experiences. Observers can explore virtual realistic environments from multiple viewpoints and learn more about the location without physically traveling. Matterport's 3D representation is available on iOs, Android, Windows PC, and HoloLens 2. ","LogMeIn Rescue is a powerful, easy-to-use remote support solution built to assist teams of all sizes, from small helpdesks to the world's largest support organizations and everyone in between. Rescue provides fast, reliable, flexible, and easy-to-use technical support for employees and customers. LogMeIn Rescue is available on iOs, Android, and Windows PC.","Telepresence robots enable customers, collaborators, or colleagues to meet in a real place in real-time from anywhere. The robot platform allows remote participants to experience and interact in real-time with the people and observe processes. The required hardware is inexpensive and entirely portable, which provides many uses within our industry. ","Immersive videos engage customers in sales, marketing objectives, brand awareness, branding recall, training, and websites. For Thermo Fisher Sales and Marketing Team's Quick to Care initiative, Altoura developed an immersive website, web intake form, custom CG animated videos, video viewers, video controls, and Google Analytics with a custom SDK to track usage. The immersive content is available online and reaches more people, so marketers get more scale and go from 1:1 to 1: many. ","Web 3D Viewer provides a 3D photorealistic digital twin view on Andriod, iOs, and web-based platforms. The viewer enhances our ability to market, sell, and promote our products' capabilities and benefits through custom 3D configurations.","Converting CAD drawings to high-quality digital twin prototypes is an expensive and time-intensive process.  CAD to 3D Automation streamlines the process allowing for rapid prototyping, scalability, and instant customer feedback. Rapid prototyping results in high-resolution 3D assets that can be used by anyone anytime.",,,,,
